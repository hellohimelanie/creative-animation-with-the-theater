# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Write a description the personal interest or problem that your animation addresses. Then explain the user story(s) you identified, and how they help frame making your animation.

I made a simple idea of an animation showing a farmer getting apples from a tree and creating applesauce. However, my partner and I agreed that sports was one of our favorite subjects to talk about instead of apple sauce so for the project, we didn't want to talk about volleyball, soccer, or track so we decided on basketball. We brainstormed ideas on what an animation should include when we're talking about basketball. Instead, our idea was to animate a basketball game with three people we know in real life and one famous basketball players. We got permission from each person to generate an AI image of them playing basketball and thats the images we used in the animation. For the opening scene we created a constructor method for the annoucer who would be announcing the game in the beginning scene, and two void methods to create the images in the scene and the sound in the scene. After, in the BasketballCourtScene class, we created player objects and just used for loops to edit the position for basketballs, players, and text. After, we just made two classes for the player and character to hold the sound file and image. In TheaterRunner, we create our 2D arrays for players and scenes and just instantiated our scene and players in the theater and called on our methods to create the scene.
